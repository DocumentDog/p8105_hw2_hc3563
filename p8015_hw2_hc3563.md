Let’s start with implementing library:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
    ## ✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5
    ## ✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1
    ## ✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1
    ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1
    ## ✔ purrr     1.0.2     
    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

### Problem 1

``` r
subway_df =
  read_csv(file='./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv', na=c("NA",".","")) |>  
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) |> 
  mutate(entry = if_else(entry == "Yes", TRUE, FALSE)) |> 
  drop_na(line, station_name, station_longitude, station_latitude, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada)
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...
    ## lgl  (2): ADA, Free Crossover
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

So far I have read and cleaned the dataset. First I imported the dataset
and clean the column names. Then I subset the columns I want to keep;
finally I change the value in “entry” column from “Yes/No” to
“TRUE/FALSE” and dropped all columns except routes since not all
stations have 11 lines. Now the dataset the clean enough and has 1868
rows and 19 columns.

``` r
#distinct station
distinct_station = subway_df |> distinct(line, station_name)
n_distinct = nrow(distinct_station)

#ADA compliant
ada_compliant = subway_df |> filter(ada == TRUE)
n_ada = nrow(ada_compliant)

#vending
vending_yes = subway_df |> filter(vending == "YES")
prop_vending = nrow(vending_yes) / nrow(subway_df)

#distinct station that serve A train
A_train = 
  subway_df |> 
  distinct(line, station_name, route1) |> 
  filter(route1 == 'A')
n_a_train = nrow(A_train)

#ADA compliant among A train serving
ada_and_A = 
  subway_df |> 
  distinct(line, station_name, route1, ada) |> 
  filter(route1 == 'A' & ada == TRUE)
n_ada_and_A = nrow(ada_and_A)
```

Using the data, we can see there are 465 distinct stations, 468 stations
are ADA compliant, and about 0.9020343 of station entrance have vending
machines. Among these distinct stations, there are 60 stations serve A
train. Among stations which serve A train, there are 17 stations are ADA
compliant.

### Problem 2

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet=1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(dumpster:homes_powered) |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)) |> 
  mutate(name = "trash_wheel") |> 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

    ## New names:
    ## • `` -> `...15`
    ## • `` -> `...16`

``` r
professor_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet=2) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(dumpster:homes_powered) |> 
  drop_na(dumpster, date) |> 
  mutate(name = "professor")

gwynnda_df =
  readxl::read_excel("./data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet=4) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(dumpster:homes_powered) |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(name = "gwynnda")

#bind the three datasets
full_df = bind_rows(trashwheel_df, professor_df, gwynnda_df)
```

By importing and cleaning excel tables, there are now three datasets
available: trashwheel_df, professor_df, and gwynnda_df. For
trashwheel_df, which is the first sheet in excel, there are 651 rows and
15 columns, and the variables are shown below: dumpster, month, year,
date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls,
homes_powered, name. Professor_df has 118 rows and 14 columns;
gwynnda_df has 263 rows and 13 columns, while both datasets do not
contain “sports_balls” variable.

``` r
total_weight = sum(professor_df$weight_tons)

total_butts =
  gwynnda_df |> 
  filter(month == "June" & year == 2022) |> 
  pull(cigarette_butts) |> 
  sum()
```

From professor_df, we can see that the total weight of trash collected
by professor trash wheel is 246.74 tons. Also, the total number of
cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022 is 1.812^{4}.
